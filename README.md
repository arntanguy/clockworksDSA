#Server

## User Environment Listener

* Listen for environment simulations from users over HTTPS, authentication is optional
* Examine Ping Queue (the number of devices that have pinged the server recently)
* Examine Code Queue (the number of objects currently waiting to be distributed)
* Split code based on number of available devices, (i.e. split amout is minimum of: pings received in the previous allowed window, space in queue and how much the code can be split) and add to code queue
* Respond to users with rejects/acknowledgements

### Database accesses:
* User authentication

### Shared variable accesses:
* Ping queue: read
* Code queue: read/write

## User Result Assembly

* Listen for [WOP](#wop-ping) pings from users over HTTPS, authentication is optional
* Check is database complete (all results returned)
* Respond to users with rejects/acknowledgement/compiled results


### Database accesses:
* User authentication
* Results: read/purge

## Bot Interface Listener

* Listen for data from devices over HTTP Post (results piggybacked on Ready To Process ping)
* If RTP (Ready to process) ping: device is available to receive object file
* If Iâ€™m still here ping: where device is still processing data, signals the server to restart the timer
* Send process files if any code in queue
* HTTP Response: timer information piggybacked with .py file
* Send vacancy response if no code in queue

### Database accesses:
* Result logging: read/write

### Shared variable accesses:
* Ping queue: read/write
* Code queue: read/write

## Timer / Timeout handlers

* One for each portion of the simulation

### Shared variable accesses:

* Code queue: write
